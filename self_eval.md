# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

    I feel pretty comfortable with comparisons. I get the less than and greater than signs confused sometimes, especially if theres a lot of nested logic and stuff but if i take it slow, I can usually work it through

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

    I feel really comfortable with these.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

    Im fine with if statements but it gets confusing when starting to nest them. I have trouble sometimes getting the logic to work the way I want if I nest a lot of statements.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

    I spent around an hour and a half on this lesson because I was having a lot of fun with the fizzbuzz assignment trying to add checks for correct user input and adding a loop.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

    I still need to practice on how if statements interact with eachother when theres a lot of them in the same block of code and nested into eachother. It gets confusing sometimes but I will practice a lot more by doing online ruby excercises and watching youtube videos before mod 1 starts.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

    Is there a better way to access a variable outside of a block of code without turning it into a global variable? I heard using global variables is not a good habit.
